i think we need to manage information on a much smaller scale than we do now to be able to seperate it from specific applications. 

(i assume we want that because i can't see a way where we can own our information and do interesting things to it without it.)

what kind of scale?

think paragraphs not essays, functions not files or directories.



we already have a technology for that: file systems. they manage information on an arbitrary tiny scale, we already know how they work, they are used by almost every application in some way and we have control over the data on them.

however.

every application decides how it stores it's data, it's easy lose track of things, it's rather difficult to find things and to be able to combine data from multiple applications it's basically a requirement to learn programming for multiple years.



i think we could use a structured data store where applications can store arbitrary tiny segments of data, but that still allows us to find our data, use it in ways the creators of these applications didn't think of and run complex queries on the data.
