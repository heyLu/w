Please cancel your TV show.

(And also stop writing so much and posting so many videos, I can't handle it. Do you mind stop making that podcast as well?)



I like self-contained things. I can read/watch/listen to them and then move on. [1] As someone from the past, trying to catch up, this isn't easy when there's always more stuff coming out. There are the classics, there are modern classics, there are an infinite amount of essential/favourite/eye-opening things.

And then there's always more.

Just one more season, split the movie into two, make a hexology out of planned triology (or short article), one episode per week and don't even get me started about the fan wikis, the articles, the commentary, the blogs or twitter.

So *please*, cancel your TV show.

You don't have to make it last a decade, you can probably say what you want to say in one essay, not the 13 books, hundreds of articles and thousands of articles.

But then, maybe you can't.

I understand this, because this thing is also too long, but it is just as well too short, doesn't even begin to cover it's own topic.

And that is already the problem: The "topic" is not just one topic, it's thousands of topics. I might start with being overwhelmed by the media, but I also need to mention a bit about me, how I grew up with (almost) no television, how I always read and it was overwhelming even without the internet. That is another 10000 words in itself, as an introduction, a lifetime for me. But it's just one aspect, among a lot of others.

(Imagine a few hundred keywords listed here, maybe I'll be back and add them later.)

If you go down this path of covering "everything" related, trying to watch everything, hear of everything, be on top of the new things and also create things yourself, you will most likely learn you can't.

Or rather, I can not.

I can't even begin to explore a fraction of these things and I haven't figured out how to handle that. It's a question I don't even engage most of the time, because I'm busy consuming all this stuff.

But even if I were, even if I thought about this more than just the few minutes of writing this tiny thing that is already too big -- even then I'd probably need a few years, lots of articles, ideas for a few books, long conversations with friends and almost strangers, a large collection of books, films, albums, artists, blogs, *people* that might be relevant to this and a lot more.

And I wouldn't have distilled it into one article to read, no 3000 words of wisdom to be imparted upon you so you can breathlessly chase after your dreams by first catching up with the accumulated product of human culture over thousands of words that's currently exploding because everyone has a voice now that you can (and should, says that article) hear now.

So, please don't cancel your TV show, go explore these things, go try and find those words.


(There is no happy ending to this story, I don't think there can be. That however, is the subject of another ...)


[1]: That might be wrong, because I should reflect on it, but it's the only way I can handle this much stuff. And besides, there aren't *that* many things that influence me. They're quite rare.

    Thinking about that for a bit, I'd love to read only those "rare" articles, but I don't see how to do that. But that's a thought to explore some other time.
