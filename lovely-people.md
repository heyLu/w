# a place for lovely people and ideas

(most likely involving technology in some fashion.)

## what

a short demo of something you've learned, then discussions about it.

basically, i miss places to talk about and experiment with technology
freely. a place where "bad" ideas are not laughed about, but discussed
why they're probably not so good and what could be better or how to work
on them.

## when

first time at the end of september, then maybe once a month. we'll see.

## where

in leipzig. maybe at the [sub:lab](http://sublab.org), or maybe in
someone's kitchen or in the park, we don't know yet.

## who

you, probably? if you want to talk about something or are interested in
any of the things below or just want a nice quiet place to talk about
technology, you should come.

i (lucas) will definitely be there, too, and some people i will invite.

## topics

possibly anything that interests you, here are some things i'm
interested in:

- clojure
- datomic (& muq)
- type theory, category theory and how it changes the way we think about
    and write software

    * [Categories from Scratch](http://science.raphael.poss.name/categories-from-scratch.html)
        is a good introduction for beginners (like me)
- math (in general, recreational, specific things)
    * [Math âˆ© Programming](http://jeremykun.com/)
    * [Vi Hart](http://vihart.com/)
    * [Lockhart's Lament](http://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf)
    * if you'd like to explain/talk about the following, please do get
        in touch:

        - fourier transforms
        - "higher level" match (n-dimensions, algebraic structures,
            ...), "Flatterland" is a very fun introduction to this
- how to design software

    designing software is something that doesn't seem to be very
    popular, but we all do it in some sort. so, i'd like to practice it
    a bit, talk about design with others.
- live coding & different approaches to programming
- art & programming languages
    * \_why's (poignant) guide to ruby is the canonical example to me,
        but there are others, not necessarily just writing but also
        interactive things
- programming paradigms, and how they help us (imperative,
    object-oriented, functional, declarative, relational, logic, ...)

## inspirations

- [kitchen table coders](http://kitchentablecoders.com), David Nolen
    talks a bit about [in this interview](http://www.infoq.com/interviews/nolen-clojurescript)
- [hacker school](http://hackerschool.com)
- [papers we love](http://papers-we-love.github.io)
- feminist/safe hacker spaces like [seattle attic](https://seattleattic.com/)
